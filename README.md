# A differential equation solver
This Python code provides implementations of numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs), including the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method with adaptive step size, the Backward Euler method for stiff ODEs, and a solver for higher-dimensional systems of ODEs. The code also includes example usage and plotting to visualize the solutions.
