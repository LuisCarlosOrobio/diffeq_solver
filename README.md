# A differential equation solver
This Python code provides implementations of numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs), including the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method with adaptive step size, the Backward Euler method for stiff ODEs, and a solver for higher-dimensional systems of ODEs. The code also includes example usage and plotting to visualize the solutions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- SciPy (for `fsolve` function)

### Installing Dependencies on macOS

You can install the required dependencies using `brew` and `pip`:

```sh
brew install python
pip install matplotlib numpy scipy
```
### Setting Up the Environment
Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LuisCarlosOrobio/diffeq_solver.git
cd diffeq_solver
```
Run the Example

```bash
python main.py
```
